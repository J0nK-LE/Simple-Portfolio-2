          Some people say it's an application that is ruining the country, but it didn't start out that way. I stumbled upon the idea when when I told a guy in the office that i would only listen to 140 characters of his nonsense at a time.

                i came up with this one when I broke my phone and had to cobble together an iPhone using two Motorola Razors for a battery.

                I've done everything from graphic design to selling boardwalk fudge. I've hosted podcasts and managed warehouses. Now see me try and build websites.
