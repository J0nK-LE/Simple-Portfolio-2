          Some people say it's an application that is ruining the country, but it didn't start out that way. I stumbled upon the idea when when I told a guy in the office that i would only listen to 140 characters of his nonsense at a time. He flipped me the bird and here we are.

                i came up with this one when I broke my phone and had to cobble together an iPhone using two Motorola Razors for a battery. I wanted my friends to be able to send me a picture but I needed to make sure it didn't stay around long and fill up the external flash drive I hot glued into it. Went through like 10 sticks of glue getting that one right.

                With those two creations under my belt who knows what amazing thing I'll create next. I want it to be something to make a lot of money and have a lot of access to everyone's stuff. Like so much stuff. Like a googolplex worth of stuff. I like the sound of that...

                Hello, my name is Jon Kelly. Did i ever tell you about the time I invented Twitter? I don't want the credit but some people just keep giving it to me. I tell them nooooo it cant be proven and they just keep saying its the truth. Oh yeah, i invented snapchat too.

            <p>
                I've done everything from graphic design to selling boardwalk fudge. I've hosted podcasts and managed warehouses. I look forward to filling my portfolio with work I actually created.
