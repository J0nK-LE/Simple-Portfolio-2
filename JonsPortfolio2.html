                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

                Hi, my name is Jon Kelly. Did i ever tell you about the time I invented websites? I don't want the credit but they keep giving it to me.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                I've done everything from graphic design to selling boardwalk fudge. I've hosted podcasts and managed warehouses. Now see me try and build websites.
